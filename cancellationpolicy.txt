This Cancellation Policy explains how clients may cancel ongoing projects or services with Reverence Technology, the required notice, financial consequences, and our rights to cancel or suspend work.
It forms part of and is subject to our full Terms and Conditions (available here). In case of any conflict, the Terms and Conditions prevail unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Nothing in this policy affects your non-excludable statutory rights under Ugandan law, including the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 2018, the Electronic Transactions Act 2011, or any applicable consumer protection legislation.
1. Document Title & Introduction
This is the official Cancellation Policy of Reverence Technology.
We provide custom website design and development, mobile application development (iOS, Android, cross-platform), custom software solutions, UI/UX design, consulting, and related digital services. All projects are bespoke, involving significant planning, resource allocation, scheduling, and irreversible work from the moment a deposit is paid and the project begins.
Because of this customized and committed nature, cancellation is treated seriously and has clear financial and deliverable consequences. We encourage clients to carefully review proposals, ask all questions, and confirm requirements before starting any paid engagement to minimize the need for cancellation.
2. Scope – What This Policy Covers
This Cancellation Policy applies to:

All active, ongoing projects under a Project Agreement, signed proposal, quote, statement of work, or invoice
Custom website development projects
Mobile app development and deployment projects
Custom software development projects
UI/UX design, prototyping, or wireframing phases
Any related consulting, training, or maintenance/retainer services explicitly included in the Project Agreement

This policy does not apply to:

Projects that have been fully completed, handed over, and accepted (final payment made)
One-off consultations, estimates, or free preliminary advice
Third-party services (hosting, domains, premium plugins, stock assets, app store fees, etc.)
Situations where work has not yet started (pre-deposit) — in such cases, no cancellation is needed as no commitment exists

3. Client-Initiated Cancellation – General Right
You (the Client) have the right to cancel an ongoing project or engagement at any time before final handover and acceptance, subject to the financial and other consequences outlined in this policy and the Terms and Conditions.
How to cancel:

Cancellation must be communicated in writing (email to reverencetech1@gmail.com is the preferred and recommended method).
Include in your notice:
Your full name and company/organization (if applicable)
Project name, quote number, invoice number, or other clear reference
The intended effective date of cancellation (if not immediate, it takes effect upon our receipt of notice)
Optional: a brief reason for cancellation (helps us improve, but is not required)


Verbal cancellations (phone, WhatsApp voice note, in-person) are not valid — written confirmation is required for clarity and record-keeping.
Cancellation takes effect on the date we receive your valid written notice, unless a later date is specified.

4. Notice Period & Timing Rules
Cancellation takes effect on the date we receive your valid written notice (via email to reverencetech1@gmail.com), unless you specify a later effective date in the notice.
Key timing rules:

There is no mandatory “cooling-off” or fixed notice period required for most custom development projects, as these are bespoke, non-standard services (unlike off-the-shelf products or subscriptions).
Cancellation is effective immediately upon receipt of notice, unless you request a delayed date (e.g., to allow completion of a current milestone).
For any ongoing retainer, maintenance, or subscription-based services (if included in your Project Agreement):
Standard notice period is 30 calendar days before the next billing cycle or renewal date.
Shorter notice may be accepted at our discretion, but you remain liable for the full notice period fees.

The earlier you cancel in the project lifecycle (e.g., after deposit but before major milestones), the lower your financial obligation typically is.
The later you cancel (e.g., after multiple milestones approved), the greater the amount due for work already performed and committed resources.

We will confirm receipt of your cancellation notice within 2–3 business days and provide a summary of the financial implications based on project status at the time of notice.
5. Financial Consequences of Cancellation
Upon client-initiated cancellation, you remain financially responsible for all value delivered and commitments made up to the effective date of cancellation. Specifically:

Full payment for:
All completed and approved milestones (non-refundable, as per our Refund Policy)
Any work in progress at the date of cancellation (calculated pro-rata based on percentage complete, or at our standard hourly rate if milestone-based billing does not apply)

Reasonable termination costs, including but not limited to:
Third-party expenses already incurred or committed on your behalf (e.g., premium plugins, stock assets, API keys, subcontractor fees)
Administrative, planning, and demobilization time
Any cancellation penalties from external providers engaged for your project

The initial deposit remains non-refundable in all cases (except where we materially fail to perform, as per the Refund Policy).
Prepaid amounts beyond the above liabilities may be refunded at our sole discretion after final accounting (typically only if very little work has started beyond the deposit). In most cases involving meaningful progress, no refund or only a partial refund will be issued.
Outstanding invoices must be settled in full before any partial refund (if applicable) is processed or before we release any remaining deliverables.

We will issue a final statement/invoice within 7–10 business days after cancellation, detailing all amounts due or any potential credit.
6. Deliverables Upon Cancellation
If you cancel before final handover and full acceptance:

You will receive partially completed Deliverables in their current state (e.g., wireframes, designs, source code snapshots, documentation drafts, prototypes, or staging builds).
Delivery is conditional on full payment of all outstanding amounts (completed milestones, work in progress, termination costs).
We will provide files via secure transfer (e.g., Google Drive, Git repository access, email zip) once payment clears.
Any intellectual property rights, licenses, or assignments (as outlined in Section 5 of the Terms and Conditions) remain conditional on full settlement of amounts due. Until paid, we retain rights to withhold access, source code, or admin credentials.
You may use the received partial work for your own purposes, but we make no warranties about its completeness, functionality, or fitness beyond what was approved up to cancellation.
We are not obligated to complete unfinished portions, provide further revisions, or support integration unless a new agreement is signed.

This ensures fairness: you get what has been paid for, while we are compensated for work performed and commitments made.


7. Cancellation by Reverence Technology
While we are committed to completing every project we accept, Reverence Technology reserves the right to cancel or suspend an engagement in the following circumstances:

Material breach by the Client
Examples include:
Failure to make payments when due (after reminder and a reasonable grace period)
Prolonged failure to provide required materials, feedback, approvals, or access (e.g., more than 30 calendar days despite repeated requests)
Breach of confidentiality, intellectual property obligations, or other material terms in the Terms and Conditions

Force majeure or impossibility
Events beyond our reasonable control (e.g., prolonged power/internet outages, government restrictions, natural disasters, or key team member unavailability due to serious illness) that make continued performance impossible or unreasonably burdensome
Mutual agreement
Both parties agree in writing to end the project early
Other valid business reasons (rare)
For example, discovery of irreconcilable conflicts of interest or ethical/legal issues that prevent continuation

Consequences when we cancel or suspend:

You remain liable for all work completed and approved up to the date of cancellation/suspension
We will issue a final invoice for outstanding amounts (including work in progress and termination costs)
Deliverables will be provided in their current state only after full payment of all due amounts
We may retain possession of source code, admin credentials, or other project assets until full settlement
If cancellation is due to your material breach, no refund of prepaid amounts will be issued beyond what is required by law
If we cancel without your material breach (extremely rare, e.g., force majeure), we will refund any prepaid amounts attributable to undelivered work, after deducting costs incurred

Suspension (e.g., for non-payment) does not count as cancellation — work may resume once the issue is resolved, with timelines extended accordingly.
8. Project Dormancy / Inactivity Clause
If a project becomes inactive due to lack of meaningful communication, feedback, content provision, approvals, or payments from the Client:

After 60 consecutive calendar days of no substantive progress or response despite our reasonable attempts to contact you (via email, phone/WhatsApp, or project tools),
We may treat the project as client-initiated cancellation for convenience.

Before applying this clause, we will:

Send at least two written reminders (email) with a 14-day response window each
Clearly warn that continued inactivity may result in project closure and application of cancellation consequences

Upon dormancy classification:

The financial and deliverable rules from Sections 5 and 6 apply (payment for work done, partial deliverables upon settlement)
The project will be formally closed in our records
Any future restart would require a new Project Agreement, potentially at updated rates and with new timelines

This clause protects both parties from indefinite “on-hold” projects that tie up resources without progress.
9. No-Cancellation Scenarios
The following situations do not allow for cancellation under this policy:

Completed and handed-over projects
Once final payment is made, all Deliverables are transferred/accepted, and the project is closed (as confirmed in writing or by handover documentation), the engagement is complete — no cancellation is possible or applicable
Approved milestones retroactively
Once a milestone is approved (or deemed accepted per the Terms and Conditions), you cannot “cancel” or reverse payment/refund for that milestone
Post-warranty support requests
Requests for fixes, updates, or enhancements after the warranty period (typically 30 days post-acceptance) are handled under a separate maintenance agreement — not as cancellation

In these cases, the project is considered finished, and any further work falls under new terms or a support contract.


7. Cancellation by Reverence Technology
Reverence Technology reserves the right to cancel or suspend an ongoing project or engagement in the following limited circumstances:

Material breach by the Client
This includes (but is not limited to):
Failure to pay any invoice when due (after written reminder and a reasonable grace period of at least 7 business days)
Prolonged failure to provide required content, feedback, approvals, access credentials, or other necessary inputs (typically more than 30 calendar days despite repeated requests)
Breach of confidentiality obligations, intellectual property representations, or any other material term in these Terms and Conditions or the Project Agreement

Force majeure or impossibility of performance
Events outside our reasonable control that prevent continuation, such as extended power/internet outages, government restrictions, natural disasters, serious illness of key personnel, or other unforeseen circumstances making performance impossible or unreasonably burdensome
Mutual written agreement
Both parties agree to end the project early
Other exceptional circumstances
Discovery of serious conflicts of interest, legal/ethical barriers, or fraud/misrepresentation that prevent lawful continuation

Consequences of our cancellation or suspension:

You remain liable for full payment of:
All completed and approved milestones
Work in progress up to the effective date of cancellation/suspension
Reasonable termination or suspension-related costs (e.g., committed third-party fees, administrative time)

We will provide partially completed Deliverables in their current state only after full settlement of all outstanding amounts
We may retain possession of source code, admin credentials, hosting access, or other project assets until payment is received in full
If cancellation is due to your material breach, no refund of prepaid amounts will be issued beyond what Ugandan law strictly requires
If we cancel without your material breach (e.g., force majeure), we will refund any prepaid amounts attributable to undelivered work, after deducting costs already incurred

Suspension (e.g., for non-payment) is not the same as cancellation — work may resume once the default is cured, with project timelines extended accordingly.
8. Project Dormancy / Inactivity Clause
If a project remains inactive due to lack of meaningful communication, feedback, content, approvals, or payments from the Client:

After 60 consecutive calendar days of no substantive progress or response (despite our reasonable efforts to re-engage via email, phone/WhatsApp, or project tools),
We may classify the project as dormant and treat it as client-initiated cancellation for convenience.

Before applying this clause, we will:

Send at least two written reminders (via email) with a clear 14-business-day response window each
Explicitly warn that continued inactivity will result in project closure and application of the cancellation financial consequences

Upon dormancy classification:

The financial obligations and deliverable rules from Sections 5 and 6 apply (payment for work done, partial deliverables upon full settlement)
The project will be formally closed in our records
Any future resumption would require a new Project Agreement, possibly at updated rates, scope, and timelines

This clause prevents indefinite “on-hold” projects that unnecessarily tie up resources and capacity.
9. No-Cancellation Scenarios
The following situations do not permit cancellation under this policy:

Fully completed and handed-over projects
Once final payment is received, all Deliverables are transferred/accepted, and the project is closed (as confirmed in writing or via handover documentation), the engagement is finished — cancellation is no longer possible
Retroactive cancellation of approved milestones
Once a milestone has been reviewed, approved (or deemed accepted per the Terms and Conditions), and payment invoiced/processed, it cannot be “cancelled” or reversed
Post-project support or warranty requests
Issues arising after the warranty period (typically 30 days post-acceptance) are handled under a separate maintenance/support agreement — not treated as cancellation
Projects in final handover stage
Once final payment is due and deliverables are ready for release (e.g., source code packaged, credentials prepared), cancellation does not relieve the obligation to complete payment for handover

In these cases, the project is considered complete or in its final phase, and any further assistance falls under new terms or a support contract.


10. Cancellation Process / How to Cancel
To ensure clear records and prompt handling, follow this simple process when cancelling:

Send written notice
Email your cancellation request to reverencetech1@gmail.com.
Use a clear subject line, for example:
“Cancellation Request – [Project Name / Quote Number / Invoice Number]”Include in the email:
Your full name and company/organization (if applicable)
Project reference (quote number, invoice number, project name, or client ID)
The effective date of cancellation (if not immediate, specify; otherwise it takes effect upon our receipt)
Optional: brief reason for cancellation (helps us improve services)
Verbal requests (phone calls, WhatsApp messages without written confirmation, in-person statements) are not sufficient — written email confirmation is required.
Our acknowledgment
We will reply within 2–3 business days confirming receipt of your notice and providing:
Confirmation of the effective cancellation date
A summary of the current project status and estimated financial implications
Next steps (e.g., final invoice preparation, partial deliverables)

Final accounting
Within 7–10 business days after confirmation:
We prepare and send a final statement/invoice detailing:
Completed/approved milestones
Work in progress
Any termination costs
Any potential refund/credit (if applicable)

You settle any outstanding balance

Deliverable handover (if applicable)
Once full payment of due amounts is received, we release partially completed deliverables (as described in Section 6) via secure file transfer, email, or shared repository access.

We aim to handle cancellations professionally and efficiently. Prompt communication helps us finalize matters quickly and fairly.
11. Exceptions & Special Cases
Certain situations may modify or override standard cancellation rules:

Force majeure events
If cancellation results from events beyond either party’s reasonable control (e.g., natural disasters, prolonged government restrictions, widespread internet/power outages), we will negotiate in good faith regarding outstanding payments, deliverables, and any refunds. Neither party will be liable for delays or non-performance caused by such events.
Disputes in progress
If a cancellation notice is sent while a formal dispute (e.g., breach claim, defect notification) is unresolved:
Cancellation does not waive or settle the underlying dispute
Any related remedies (fixes, credits, refunds) will be addressed separately under the Terms and Conditions or Refund Policy

Statutory or court-ordered cancellation/refunds
If Ugandan law, a competent court, or regulatory authority requires cancellation or refund rights that differ from this policy, those legal requirements will take precedence. Nothing in this policy limits or excludes non-excludable statutory rights.
Maintenance / retainer agreements
If your engagement includes ongoing support, hosting, or monthly retainers:
Cancellation requires 30 calendar days' written notice (or as specified in the agreement)
You remain liable for fees during the notice period
Services cease at the end of the notice period

Early-stage cancellations (pre-milestone)
If cancellation occurs very early (after deposit but before any milestone approval and with minimal work started), we may apply a more lenient approach to termination costs — at our discretion — while the deposit remains non-refundable.

These exceptions ensure flexibility where required by law or fairness, while maintaining the core principles of payment for value delivered.


12. Relationship to Refund Policy & Terms and Conditions
This Cancellation Policy is an integral part of our overall legal framework and works in conjunction with:

Our Refund Policy (which governs when and how any prepaid amounts may be returned after cancellation)
Our full Terms and Conditions (which contain detailed rules on payments, intellectual property, warranties, termination, liability, and more)

In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between this Cancellation Policy and the Terms and Conditions or Refund Policy:

The provisions of the Terms and Conditions shall prevail unless this policy explicitly states otherwise.
Cancellation frequently triggers application of the Refund Policy rules (e.g., non-refundable deposits, payment for approved milestones, pro-rata work in progress).

By engaging our services, signing a Project Agreement, making any payment, or proceeding with work, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to this Cancellation Policy, the Refund Policy, and the Terms and Conditions in their entirety.

You can cancel any time with written email notice.
You pay for all completed/approved work + work in progress + reasonable termination costs.
Deposit is always non-refundable; refunds of excess prepaid amounts are rare and discretionary.
We may treat long inactivity (60+ days) as cancellation.
Completed/handed-over projects cannot be cancelled.
Contact us early if issues arise — we prefer to resolve collaboratively before formal cancellation.

This policy may be updated from time to time in line with Section 11 of the Terms and Conditions (Changes to Terms). The most current version is always available on our website.
We value every client relationship and strive to deliver successful digital solutions. Cancellation is a last resort — if challenges arise during a project, please reach out as soon as possible so we can explore adjustments, extensions, or alternative solutions together.
