This Refund Policy explains when and how refunds may be issued for our services. It forms part of and is subject to our full Terms and Conditions (available here). In case of any conflict, the Terms and Conditions prevail unless explicitly stated otherwise.
Nothing in this policy affects your non-excludable statutory rights under Ugandan law, including the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 2018, the Electronic Transactions Act 2011, or any applicable consumer protection legislation.
1. Document Title & Introduction
This is the official Refund Policy of Reverence Technology.
We specialize in custom website design and development, mobile application development (iOS, Android, cross-platform), custom software solutions, UI/UX design, consulting, and related digital services. All our work is bespoke, tailored to each client’s specific requirements, and involves significant time, expertise, planning, design, coding, testing, and resource commitment from the outset.
Because of the highly customized and non-reusable nature of our Services, refunds are limited and issued only in exceptional circumstances as described below.
2. Scope – What This Policy Covers
This Refund Policy applies to all paid services provided by Reverence Technology under a Project Agreement, proposal, quote, statement of work, invoice, or any other form of engagement.
It covers:

Custom website development
Mobile app development and deployment
Custom software development
UI/UX design, prototyping, and wireframing
Related consulting, training, or maintenance packages (where explicitly included in the Project Agreement)

This policy does not apply to:

Third-party costs (hosting, domains, premium plugins, stock assets, API subscriptions, app store fees)
Ongoing recurring services (unless separately agreed)
Free consultations, estimates, or preliminary advice

3. General Principle: Custom Work is Generally Non-Refundable
Due to the custom, project-based, and labor-intensive nature of our Services:

Deposits and payments for completed or approved milestones are non-refundable.
Once work begins, we allocate developer time, conduct research, create designs, write code, perform testing, and commit resources that cannot be repurposed for other clients.
Refunds are rare and only considered in cases of our material non-performance or fundamental breach after reasonable opportunity to remedy.

We strongly encourage clients to review proposals, ask questions, and provide clear requirements before signing or paying any deposit to ensure alignment and avoid dissatisfaction.
4. Deposits
The initial deposit (typically 30–50% of the total project fee, as specified in your Project Agreement, quote, or invoice) is non-refundable in almost all circumstances.
Reasons deposits are non-refundable:

They secure your project slot in our development schedule
They cover initial project setup, scoping meetings, requirements analysis, research, wireframing preparation, environment setup, and early creative/technical work
They compensate for opportunity cost (time reserved that could have been allocated to other paying projects)

Very limited exceptions where a deposit may be refunded (in full or in part):

We are unable or unwilling to commence work due to our own fault (e.g., we cancel the project without valid cause shortly after receiving the deposit)
Material misrepresentation or fraud on our part that prevents us from delivering the Services as agreed
Situations where refund is required by Ugandan law or a competent court

In all other cases — including change of mind, revised business priorities, inability to provide timely feedback/content, or project delays caused by the client — the deposit remains non-refundable.


5. Milestone & Progress Payments
Payments tied to project milestones (as defined in your Project Agreement, quote, or invoice) are non-refundable once the milestone is completed and approved (or deemed accepted per our Terms and Conditions).
What this means in practice:

Milestone examples include: approval of wireframes/UI designs, completion and approval of beta version or functional prototype, successful integration of key features, completion of User Acceptance Testing (UAT), or delivery of staging environment.
When you provide written approval (or fail to provide written rejection with specific defects within the agreed Review Period — typically 5–7 business days), the milestone is considered accepted.
The associated milestone payment then becomes final and non-refundable, as it reflects delivered and accepted value: completed design work, coded functionality, testing, revisions incorporated, etc.

No refunds will be issued for:

Approved milestones where the client later changes their mind, revises requirements, or decides the work no longer aligns with evolving needs.
Subjective dissatisfaction (e.g., “I don’t like the design style anymore”) after approval — approval is final.
Work that meets the agreed specifications but is affected by external factors (e.g., market changes, business pivots).

If verifiable defects are reported during the Review Period or the post-acceptance warranty phase (typically 30 days), we will correct them at no extra cost as the primary remedy — not through refund.
6. Final Payment & Handover
The final payment (typically the remaining 10–20% balance) is due before we complete project handover. This includes:

Delivery of final source code/files
Transfer of admin credentials, hosting access, domain control (if managed by us)
Deployment to live/production environment
Final training/documentation/handover session (if included)
Closure of the project

Key rules:

Final payment is non-refundable once paid and the project is handed over/accepted.
We will not release full deliverables or access until the final invoice is settled in full.
After handover and acceptance, no refunds are available for the final payment or any prior payments — the project is considered complete.
If final payment is delayed, we may suspend access or withhold deliverables until cleared (with reasonable notice).

This ensures mutual commitment at the close of the project.
7. Cancellation by Client Before Completion
You may cancel the project at any time before final handover by providing written notice (email to reverencetech1@gmail.com is acceptable).
Upon cancellation, the following applies:

You remain fully liable for:
All completed and approved milestones (non-refundable)
All work in progress up to the date we receive your cancellation notice (billed pro-rata based on percentage complete or at our standard hourly rate if not milestone-based)
Reasonable termination costs, including:
Committed third-party expenses (e.g., premium tools/licenses procured for your project)
Cancellation fees from subcontractors (if any)
Administrative and demobilization time


Any prepaid amounts (beyond the above liabilities) may be refunded at our discretion, after deducting all due amounts. In most cases involving significant progress, little or no refund will be available.
If cancellation occurs very early (before any milestones are approved and minimal work has started), we may refund a portion of payments beyond the deposit — but the deposit remains non-refundable.
We will deliver any partially completed work in its current state (subject to full payment of outstanding amounts).
All licenses/assignments of intellectual property (per Section 5 of the Terms and Conditions) remain conditional on full payment of amounts due upon cancellation.

Cancellation does not relieve you of obligations for work already performed or committed resources.


8. Refund Triggers (When a Refund Might Be Issued)
Refunds are exceptional and only considered in very limited situations where Reverence Technology has materially failed to perform its obligations. Possible refund triggers include:

Material breach by Reverence Technology
We fail to deliver the core Services as materially agreed in the Project Agreement (after you have given reasonable written notice and an opportunity to remedy the issue, typically 14 business days). In such cases, you may be entitled to a partial refund for the undelivered or unusable portions of the project, less the value of any work completed, approved milestones, and expenses incurred.
Fundamental non-performance
We are unable to complete the project due to our own fault (e.g., prolonged unavailability of key team members without valid reason, or persistent failure to meet agreed specifications despite repeated attempts to correct).
Company-initiated cancellation without cause
If we terminate the project for convenience or without your material breach (rare), we will refund any prepaid amounts attributable to undelivered work, after deducting costs already incurred.
Court or statutory order
A competent Ugandan court or regulatory authority requires a refund under applicable consumer protection or contract law.

Process note: Even in these cases, refunds are discretionary unless legally mandated. We will first attempt to remedy the issue through corrections, additional work, credits for future services, or other fair solutions before considering a monetary refund.
9. No Refunds For
To set clear expectations, the following situations do not qualify for a refund:

Change of mind, revised business priorities, or new strategic direction after any milestone has been approved
Subjective dissatisfaction with aesthetics, design choices, functionality, or user experience once a deliverable has been reviewed and accepted (or deemed accepted)
Delays or issues caused by your late or incomplete provision of content, feedback, approvals, access credentials, third-party APIs, or other required inputs
Introduction of new requirements, features, or scope changes mid-project that were not part of the original Project Agreement
Third-party factors outside our control (e.g., hosting provider downtime, domain registration issues, payment gateway failures, app store rejections, changes in browser/OS compatibility, or third-party plugin/API unavailability)
Completed and approved work that no longer suits your needs due to market changes, internal reorganization, or other client-side developments
Minor bugs, cosmetic issues, or performance optimizations that can be (and are) addressed during the warranty period
Normal project iterations or reasonable revisions already provided within the agreed scope
Any portion of the project where payment has been made for delivered and accepted value

In these situations, our primary remedy remains fixing verifiable defects during the warranty phase (see below) or discussing scope adjustments via a Change Order — not refunds.
10. Warranty / Bug-Fix Period (Cross-Reference)
As detailed in our Terms and Conditions (Section 6 – Warranties and Acceptance):

We provide a limited post-acceptance warranty period (typically 30 days from final project acceptance, or longer if specified in your Project Agreement).
During this period, we will investigate and correct — at no additional charge — any verifiable bugs or defects that cause the Deliverables to materially deviate from the agreed specifications existing at the time of acceptance.
This warranty covers only pre-existing defects, not:
New features or enhancements
Client-requested changes
Issues arising from unauthorized modifications, misuse, or third-party interference
Normal maintenance or performance tuning post-handover


The bug-fix process is the primary and exclusive remedy for issues discovered during the warranty period. Refunds are not available for problems that can be resolved through corrections under this warranty.
After the warranty expires, any further support, fixes, updates, or enhancements are provided under a separate maintenance/support agreement (billed at our standard rates).


11. Refund Process (How to Request & Timeline)
If you believe a situation qualifies for a refund under this policy (e.g., material non-performance on our part), follow this process:

Submit a written request
Send an email to reverencetech1@gmail.com with the subject line: “Refund Request – [Project Name/Reference Number]”. Include:
Your full name and company/organization (if applicable)
Project name, quote/invoice number, or other reference
Detailed explanation of the reason for the request
Relevant evidence (e.g., screenshots, correspondence, description of defects or non-delivery)
The specific amount or portion you are requesting to be refunded

Our review
We will acknowledge receipt within 2–3 business days and conduct a full review (typically completed within 7–14 business days). This may include:
Reviewing project files, communications, approvals, and milestones
Consulting with the development team
Verifying any reported defects or non-performance

Decision and communication
We will notify you in writing (email) of the outcome, including:
Whether a refund is approved (in full, partial, or denied)
The reasoning
If approved: the amount and method

Refund issuance
Approved refunds will be processed within 10–30 business days after final agreement:
To the original payment method (bank transfer, mobile money, etc.) where possible
Or, at our discretion, as store credit/project credit toward future work
Any transaction fees, taxes, or third-party charges are not refunded


Note: Refunds are processed manually and may take longer during peak periods or public holidays. We do not offer instant refunds.
12. Statutory Rights Disclaimer
Nothing in this Refund Policy limits or excludes any rights you may have under Ugandan law that cannot be lawfully excluded or restricted. This includes (but is not limited to):

Rights under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act, 2018 (reasonable care and skill in service provision)
Rights under the Electronic Transactions Act, 2011 (for electronic contracts and remedies in distance/digital services)
Any applicable consumer protection provisions that deem certain terms unfair or unenforceable

If any provision of this policy is found to be unenforceable under Ugandan law, the remaining provisions remain in full effect, and we will apply the most client-favorable interpretation permitted by law.
